# Deploy your bot to different platforms

To link a channel to your bot:

!!! info "Note"
    Not all channels require a provider.

- Choose a [provider][2] for your channel.
- [Configure a messaging provider][6]. You will need to get the required credentials from your chosen provider.
- Once the provider is set up, navigate to your bot on OCS and click the plus icon in the "Channels" section.
- Choose your channel and complete the form. Follow the guide below to get the required information for each channel.

## Web and API
The web channel uses the web interface and is enabled by default for all bots. Likewise, all bots can be accessed via the [APIs][api].

## Telegram
- Follow [this guide][1] to create a Telegram bot.
- Copy the bot token and paste it into the form on OCS. It will look something like this: `4839574812:AAFD39kkdpWt3ywyRZergyOLMaJhac60qc`.


!!! info "Note"
    Depending on your usecase, you probably want to disable group joins for your bot on Telegram. Since your telegram bot is public, anyone can add it to a group, which could end up costing you a lot. To achieve this, use the [setjoingroups][5] setting in BotFather.

## WhatsApp
- Add your WhatsApp number to the form.
- After you submit the form, you will be provided with a webhook URL. Copy this URL and paste it in the 'webhook url' input at your provider. You can also get this URL by clicking on your WhatsApp channel again.
    - For Twilio, see [this page][3]
    - For Turn.io, go to your settings -> API & Webhooks -> Add a webhook and paste the OCS webhook URL


## Facebook Messenger
!!! info "Note"
    It is assumed that you already have a Facebook page and a Twilio account with the Facebook page linked. Follow [this guide][4] if this is not the case.

- Add the ID of your Facebook page.
- After you submit the form, you will be provided with a webhook URL. Copy this URL and navigate back to your provider's settings to configure it with this URL.
    - For Twilio, edit your Facebook page settings and paste the URL into the "Webhook URL for incoming messages" field.

## Slack
- Choose the channel mode.
- If you chose to link a specific channel, enter the name of the Slack channel you want your bot to be available on.
- Once the channel is linked, you will be able to chat with it using the `@Dimagi Bots` reference.

## SureAdhere
- Enter the Tenant ID that would have been provided to you when setting up your SureAdhere account.
- After you submit the form, you will be provided with a webhook URL. Copy this URL and navigate back to your provider's settings to configure it with this URL.
