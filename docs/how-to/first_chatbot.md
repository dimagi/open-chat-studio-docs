# Create your first chatbot

In this video, I walk you through the basic steps to set up your first chatbot in Open Chat Studio. We start by creating an LLM provider, which allows us to connect with services like OpenAI or Anthropic; I chose Anthropic and entered my API key. I then created a chatbot and test it out. After testing the chatbot to ensure it functions correctly, I explain the importance of versioning to maintain user experience while making updates. I encourage you to follow along and create your own chatbot using these steps.
