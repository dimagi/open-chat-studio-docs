# Open Chat Studio

This is the home page for all documentation related to [Open Chat Studio](https://github.com/dimagi/open-chat-studio).
Developed by Dimagi, Open Chat Studio is an easy-to-use, open source platform for rapidly prototyping, testing and
deploying chatbots created using Large Language Models (LLMs).

## What can I do on Open Chat Studio?

* **Make Your Own Chatbots:** With Open Chat Studio (OCS), you can easily create your own chatbots using advanced
  language technology. OCS is built for use by program staff and other teams - you don't need to be an engineer to get
  started.

* **Deploy:** Use Open Chat Studio to launch your chatbots on the web and mobile apps such as Telegram and WhatsApp,
  with more
  options coming soon.

* **Enable Access for All:** Anyone you share a chatbot with will be able to access it, either through a web link or
  directly
  on platforms such as WhatsApp or Telegram. Chatbot users do not need to have an account on Open Chat Studio to use
  your
  chatbots.

* **View and Download Data:** View and export the data from interactions with your chatbots, formatted In CSV.
