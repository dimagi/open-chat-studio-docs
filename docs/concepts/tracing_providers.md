# Tracing Providers

LLM tracing involves capturing a model's output and decision-making process. Tracing providers offer platforms to visualize and analyze these traces, aiding bot developers in understanding their model's behavior.

Open Chat Studio (OCS) has built-in support for the following providers:

- [LangFuse](langfuse)
- [LangSmith](langsmith)


Tracing will automatically begin with the next conversation after configuring a tracing provider.
