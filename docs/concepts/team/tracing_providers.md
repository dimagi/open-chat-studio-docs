# Tracing Providers

LLM tracing involves capturing a model's output and decision-making process. Tracing providers offer platforms to visualize and analyze these traces, aiding bot developers in understanding their chatbot's behavior.

Open Chat Studio (OCS) has built-in support for the following providers:

- [LangFuse][langfuse]
- [LangSmith][langsmith]


Tracing will automatically begin with the next conversation after configuring a tracing provider.
