# Frequently Asked Questions

### Are my exisiting Experiments going to be lost after the upgrade from Experiements to Chatbots?
No! This update is solely in the bot building experience and not in the end product the user sees. All exisiting experiments will be seemlessly transferred over to Chatbots without change in any of the chatbot functionality.

### What do I have to do during the Experiments to Chatbots transition?
Nothing! All of your exerpriments will be transferred over to use chatbots automatically. You will recieve updates on the progress of the transition via banners on the site.

### How do I adjust the global settings of my chatbot?
Different from an Experiment, the settings have been moved to a tab on the Chatbot homepage.
