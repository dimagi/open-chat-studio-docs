# Channels

To enable users to interact with your bot through external social media platforms and similar services, OCS integrates with various [messaging providers][1]. This integration allows you to deploy your bot to external platforms. Once a platform is linked to your bot, users can communicate with it through that platform. In OCS, the term "channel" is synonymous with "platform."

The currently supported channels are:

- Telegram
- WhatsApp
- Facebook Messenger
- Slack
- API
<!-- - SureAdhere -->
